            This is a message, written and contributed directly by the

            Throughout a period of around 15 years, we saw that the social
            contract has been quite severely broken. This dates as far back as
            the 2008 financial crisis.

            Thereâ€™s a disconnect between expectations and experiences. Your
            lived experience. Your product experiences. Your service
            experiences. Your community experiences, and so on.

            So we exist to rid the world of the problem - the issue that is
            underwhelming human experience. In whatever forms it may take,
            starting with business and commerce.
