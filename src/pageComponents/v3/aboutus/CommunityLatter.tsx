						To our community at Particular and all of Humankind,
						<br />
						<br />
						This is a message, written and contributed directly by the
						Particular directors, and we extend our hand in wishing you the
						warmest welcome into the Particular community.
						<br />
						<br />
						Throughout a period of around 15 years, we saw that the social
						contract has been quite severely broken. This dates as far back as
						the 2008 financial crisis.
					</p>
					<p className="desc body-regular-1 text-center mb-6 text-mono-100 mx-auto max-w-[766px] w-full !opacity-70">
						Thereâ€™s a disconnect between expectations and experiences. Your
						lived experience. Your product experiences. Your service
						experiences. Your community experiences, and so on.
					</p>
					<p className="desc body-regular-1 text-center text-mono-100 mx-auto max-w-[766px] w-full !opacity-50">
						So we exist to rid the world of the problem - the issue that is
						underwhelming human experience. In whatever forms it may take,
						starting with business and commerce.
