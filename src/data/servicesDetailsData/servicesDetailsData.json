You can learn the full details through our Maintenance & Hosting Guide. However, this is not a compulsory action. We prefer for our clients to have the choice so that hosting with us may be a willing action, rather than a term of engagement.

        "id": 1,
        "question": "What’s the difference between Local, National and International SEO?",
        "answer": "Local SEO is a strategy tailored to businesses looking to attract customers from a specific local area, like a city or county region. It involves targeting location-specific keywords, such as 'plumber in Liverpool' or 'Italian restaurant near me.' Local SEO efforts include optimising Google My Business listings, managing local citations, encouraging online reviews, and creating location-specific content. It's highly beneficial for businesses with a physical presence, like restaurants, local shops, plumbers, dentists, and hair salons. National SEO, on the other hand, is designed for businesses with a broader, national audience. The focus here is on attracting customers across an entire country without the need for specific location modifiers in keywords. National SEO involves targeting more generic or industry-related keywords, building high-quality backlinks, creating comprehensive content, and optimising the website's technical aspects to compete at a national level. It's often used by e-commerce websites, large corporations, and businesses with products or services that cater to a nationwide market. International SEO is the strategy for businesses with a global reach and the ambition to attract a worldwide customer base. It necessitates the targeting of keywords relevant to multiple countries or regions, often in various languages. International SEO efforts may include implementing tags to indicate language and regional targeting, adapting currency and pricing structures, and optimizing for different search engines popular in various regions. This approach is typically employed by large multinational corporations, global e-commerce sites, and businesses with a presence in multiple countries to expand their reach and cater to diverse international audiences. These three types of SEO vary in their geographic focus and require distinct strategies and techniques to effectively reach the intended audience. The choice of which type to pursue depends on your business goals, target audience, and the extent of your geographic reach. Many businesses may employ a combination of these strategies to effectively connect with both local and global customers."

        "question": "What is SEO? How can it help my website and business?",
        "answer": "SEO stands for Search Engine Optimisation, and it refers to the practice of optimising your website and overall online content to improve your website’s (and brand’s) visibility and ranking in search engine results, such as Google, Bing, and Yahoo. The primary goal of SEO is to increase the quantity and quality of organic (non-paid) traffic to your website. This is achieved through various strategies and techniques designed to make your website more attractive to search engines and, consequently, more appealing to users."
      },
      {
        "id": 3,
        "question": "Do I have to pay for SEO forever?",
        "answer": "No, ongoing SEO is purely an optional move for any business, although it can be more beneficial for some businesses than others. Where your market niche is quite competitive, ongoing SEO is a smart way to stay present in the eyes of customers, encouraging more sales and interaction with your business online. The principles that go into SEO are those which generally contribute to having a better, more engaging, more interactive website anyway, so it’s usually a good way to invest in your company - at least for a while. Particular SEO packages are offered on a monthly-rolling basis with no long-term commitment. Results will vary based on your investment horizon and may take up to 6 months to see web traffic results."
      },
      {
        "id": 4,
        "question": "SEO doesn’t give results straight away? How long does it take for SEO to work?",
        "answer": "SEO is a long-term strategy, and it typically does not yield immediate results. The time it takes for SEO to work and show significant results can vary based on several factors. While there is no fixed timeframe for SEO results, you can generally expect to see noticeable improvements in your organic search traffic and rankings within several months. Significant results may take anywhere from 6 months to a year or more, depending on the factors mentioned above. However, it's important to remember that SEO is an investment in the long-term success of your website, and the benefits it provides can continue to grow over time as your efforts compound. Patience and consistent effort are key to achieving success with SEO."
