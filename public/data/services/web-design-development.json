In such instances, the complete website may or will likely be launched so that you are able to proceed with your continued marketing efforts. However, the website will not be fully-owned by you until payment is complete in full. *Paid in full meaning the project quote, excluding any fees proposed for website hosting and maintenance by Particular Agency."
